# Cross-Layer Invariant Audit Matrix (Superseded)

This matrix has been superseded by the folder-focused comprehensive audit:

- Canonical matrix: [folder-audit-matrix-2026-02-13.md](folder-audit-matrix-2026-02-13.md)

Reason:
- The newer matrix includes full folder-touching mutation inventory across core/server/gui/tools and is the maintained source of truth for invariant coverage.

Do not add new coverage data here; update the canonical folder audit matrix instead.
