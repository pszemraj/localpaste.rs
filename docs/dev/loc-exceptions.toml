# LoC exceptions for check-loc.
#
# Each exception must include:
# - path: workspace-relative Rust file path
# - max_lines: temporary per-file cap for that path
# - reason: concrete rationale for why the exception exists
#
# Example:
# [[exceptions]]
# path = "crates/localpaste_gui/src/app/mod.rs"
# max_lines = 1200
# reason = "Temporary during editor state extraction work"

[[exceptions]]
path = "crates/localpaste_gui/src/app/highlight/mod.rs"
max_lines = 1200
reason = "Temporary while syntax resolution and worker/cache logic remain co-located; split planned after Magika rollout."
